# Dad-A-Base
Are you a lover of some very corny, punny jokes? Get ready to laugh! The Dad-A-Base is a website that hosts all of the wonderful dad jokes that I see as I browse the internet. The site was initially built with React, but I opted for a Svelte redesign! 

## Jokes
I make sure to carefully check all jokes to avoid anything that could be deemed offensive. If you see a joke that you think is offesnive that I posted on the website, please create an issue and let me know so I can remove it!

## Navigation
You can either view a random joke or see a list of all jokes.

**Note: Because Heroku has dropped their free plan, this project is no longer running. The site itself is not hosted on Heroku, but the backend is. I will be moving it to a new platform soon.**
